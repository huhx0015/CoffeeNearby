## Description

Coffee Nearby: An Android application that displays a list of coffee shops using the Yelp AI API. Coffee Nearby was developed entirely in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, utilizing MVI architecture and leveraging modern dependencies such as Hilt, Coil, Retrofit 2, Moshi, and OkHttp.

Please note that a Yelp AI developer key is required to compile and run this project. A Yelp AI developer key can be obtained from: https://docs.developer.yelp.com/

Once obtained, a root file called "keys.properties" will need to be created, with the following fields defined:
* YELP_API_KEY
* YELP_BASE_URL
* YELP_CLIENT_ID
